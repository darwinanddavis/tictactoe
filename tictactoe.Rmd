## Overview  

Develop the consumer-resource disease transmission model of parasite loading on nutrient cycling in ecosystems as a spatial individual-based model.   

To forecast how resource biomass uptake and release by infected and non-infected host populations varies under a disease mosaic landscape driven by feedback between modes and rates of disease transmission and costs of parasite occurrence and nutrient deposit in space and time.      

The model applies the [nutrient-plant-susceptible-infectious (NPSI) model](https://github.com/darwinanddavis/LECWorkingGroup) in a spatial landscape of resources, host populations, and disease vector populations.  

## The rundown

The model explores the transmission probability of diseases among host populations in a simulated patchwork landscape of resource and disease patches. The two main entities are host individuals (agents) and patches. Hosts are mobile units that move throughout the model landscape using user-defined movement/patch occurrence rules and aim to consume the resource patches that provide them with energy to fuel their growth/death rates. Individuals belong to host populations that are either susceptible to infection risk (S) or infected with a disease (I).   

The probability of a susceptible host becoming infected is determined via two pathways:  

-	Encounter food and/or ground patches in the landscape that contain parasites, such as diseased food or infected waste (faeces or carcasses of infected hosts).  

-	Encounter infected hosts on a shared food and/or ground patch.  
  
Infected hosts can transmit parasites to susceptible hosts. Infected hosts cannot be infected further, but can shed their parasites, after which they reset their infection probability and become susceptible again.    

Patches in the landscape are either ground, resources, or infected patches (ground or resources). Resource patch growth rates depend on nutrient supply in a patch. Bare ground patches can become resource patches when their nutrient load is sufficient to grow resources. Resource patches are consumed if 1) the patch is occupied by individual/multiple hosts and 2) the host requires energy.    

All rates of nutrient supply, resource growth, and host population densities are determined by the state variable ODEs (defined below).   

## From individual to population

The model can be as simple or as complex as we want it to be. The best way to build the model is to keep our main research questions at the forefront as we modify the model assumptions. This will help us confine the aims of the model and what we feed into it, which is limited by available data. 

The model uses individual hosts as units and patches as cells that contain information on how the individual will update its current state at each time step. For example, a host that begins the simulation at time step 0 as susceptible will encounter food patches at different time steps, which update its energetic state. If this host then encounters an infected host at time step 5, the state of this newly infected host will change to infected. This newly infected host then updates its current energetic state at time step 6 to reflect the consequences of its body condition being infected.  

The nutrient and resource load of patches also varies per time step as patches are updated with new nutrients, consumed by hosts, or infected by infected products or carcasses.  

While the units are the individual hosts, the patterns emerging from the simulation are at the host population level. This keeps the transmission dynamics within a susceptible/infected population framework that corresponds to the output of biomass back into the landscape. The rates of transmission and resource growth are at faster time scales than host birth/death rates. Therefore, varying these rates and the values that feed these rates will determine what the model simulations produce throughout the different time and space scales.    

## Methods  

### Model description   

**State variables (units = biomass)**  
N = nutrients in the landscape (biomass)  
P = food in the landscape (plant biomass)  
S = susceptible ungulate host population  
I = infected ungulate host population   

**Parameters**    
r = intrinsic growth rate of plants   
K = carrying capacity of plants  
a = rate of nutrient addition  
l = nutrient loss rate  
fp = rate of plant nutrient uptake  
$\beta$ = transmission rate  
es = assimilation efficiency of susceptible hosts  
ei = assimilation efficiency of infected hosts  
fs = feeding rate of susceptible hosts  
fi = feeding rate of infected hosts  
d = background host death rate  
v = mortality rate from infection  
ws = rate of waste production from susceptible hosts  
wi = rate of waste production from infected hosts  

### State variable ODEs      

Nutrient growth (biomass)  
$$
\frac
{dN}
{dt} = 
a - lN - fpNP + (d+ws)S + (d+v+wi)I  
$$

Food growth (biomass)  
$$
\frac
{dP}
{dt} = 
fpNrP(1-(P/K)) - P(fsS+fiI) 
$$

Susceptible host density   
$$
\frac
{dS}
{dt}
= P(esfsS + eifiI) - \beta S - (d+ws)S 
$$

Infected host density    
$$
\frac
{dI}
{dt}
= \beta S - (d+v+wi)I 
$$


![Example of what the model landscape might look like with food patches (green), infected patches (brown), and host individuals (white = S, red = I).](landscape2.jpeg)  

The interplay between the fast (e.g. feeding, disease transmission) and slow (e.g. nutrient cycling, birth/death) rate dynamics at different time and space scales generates emergent patterns for the different state variable and parameter values we use to define the model starting conditions and inputs.  

## Questions to answer    

Some examples of questions we could answer:  

-	What density of infected patches in the landscape increases transmission and mortality rates?  

-	How does host density per patch drive disease transmission rates?  

-	What density of infected resources drives direct mortality (host density per infected patch) versus indirect mortality (horizontal disease transmission from newly born infected hosts)?  

-	How does persistence of infected host density shape infected patch arrangement in the landscape and ultimately exposure risk to susceptible hosts?  

-	What density of infected hosts suppresses nutrient stocks to levels below unsustainable food growth?     

-	Etc    
   

## Extensions of the model    

The model landscape can also include free-ranging, mobile disease vectors, i.e. mosquitoes and ticks, that have their own basic movement rules. This can follow three modes:  

-	Opportunistic, where vectors follow correlated random walk in the landscape and host-vector encounter rates are probabilistic based on vector and susceptible host density per patch.  

-	Recurring, where vector density in the landscape peaks according to regular rollout events throughout the simulation. This aims to follow vector occurrence patterns that correlate with predictable natural phenomena i.e. seasonal fluctuations in humidity.  

-	Episodic, where the landscape is ‘flooded’ with vectors at given times throughout the simulation. This aims to replicate sudden disease outbreaks in a given spatial area that may correspond to climate, human-induced, and/or epidemic events.
