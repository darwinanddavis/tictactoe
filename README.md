Ideas behind this research were developed at the Living Earth Collaborative working group on the effects of parasites on ecosystem nutrient cycling, Washington University, St. Louis, MO, USA, December 4-7, 2018.    

## Overview    

Develop the consumer-resource disease transmission model of parasite loading on nutrient cycling in ecosystems as a spatial individual-based model to forecast how resource biomass uptake and release by infected and non-infected host populations varies under a disease mosaic landscape driven by feedback between modes and rates of disease transmission and costs of pathogen and nutrient deposit in space.    

## Instructions for running the model    

:one: Download the model instructions document.  
:two: Open and run the simulation model in `R`.  

## Troubleshooting  

All troubleshooting and bugs can be sent as a git issue or to matthew.malishev [at] emory.edu.
