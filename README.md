## Overview  

Develop the consumer-resource disease transmission model of parasite loading on nutrient cycling in ecosystems as a spatial individual-based model.   

To forecast how resource biomass uptake and release by infected and non-infected host populations varies under a disease mosaic landscape driven by feedback between modes and rates of disease transmission and costs of parasite occurrence and nutrient deposit in space and time.       

[See the PDF document](https://github.com/darwinanddavis/tictactoe/blob/master/tictactoe.pdf) for an overview of the model.
